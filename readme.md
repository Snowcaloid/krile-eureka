# Snowcaloid Discord bot

Created using Python.

## Requirements

Install docker on your machine.
After installing docker, you need to set up a couple of variables - for this, you need to create a `.env` file with the approperiate variables from `.env.example`. Additionally, the `docker-compose.yaml` needs to be adjusted for the same variables (TODO).
To start the production version, `docker-compose up --build -d`

For debugging from vs code, additional setup is required. // TODO
