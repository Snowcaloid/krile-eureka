  **The passcode for all Parties 1-6 is %passcode.**
  This will not work for the Support Party.

  Notes:
  1: Please bring proper logograms. If you do not bring and use Spirit of the Remembered we will not revive you.
  2: We can not revive players normally in BA, so please bear this in mind and do mechanics properly.
  3: If you die on trash mobs, this will usually result in you not being revived. There is no reason to die on them, so please wait 5s for the tank to establish aggro.
